# DC20 Support

This is a simple repository for exploring DC20-related supporting content in a version-controlled manner.

## Documents
- [CUL & CCL License Proposal](./docs/license.md): The core licensing. This should be its own webpage or section of a printed medium where appropriate.
- [Document Terms](./docs/terms.md): This is the one-page set of terms that should be included in all source PDFs near the beginning.
- [Small Format](./docs/small.md): These formats can be included in smaller formats like stat blocks, digital tool footers, or accredidation for video content. These formats link back to the original license document.
