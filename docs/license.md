# **1. DC20 Community Use License (CUL)**

*Friendly fan & community license for personal, educational, and non-commercial projects*

---

## **Purpose**

The DC20 Community Use License allows fans, players, streamers, and hobby creators to use DC20 content in their own games, streams, and free creations — while protecting the creators of DC20 and ensuring the game can continue to grow.

If you’re not selling your work or making money from it, this is the license for you.

---

## **What You Can Do (Allowed Uses)**

Under the DC20 Community Use License, you may:

* **Play** DC20 in person or online.
* **Stream or record** your games on platforms like Twitch, YouTube, or podcasts.
* **Create and share** free homebrew content, including adventures, classes, monsters, magic items, and rules variants.
* **Build and share** free tools, apps, or VTT modules that work with DC20 rules — as long as they follow the Content Access Rules below.
* **Quote small excerpts** from DC20 books (such as a single stat block, table, or rule) for reference, review, or commentary in a free, non-commercial work.

---

## **Content Access Rules for Tools and Apps**

If your tool, app, or VTT module includes **full text** from any paid DC20 product (such as monster stats, magic item descriptions, or class abilities):

1. You must ensure **only owners of that product can access it**.

   * Acceptable methods: store login, purchase verification, license key, or similar.
2. Free previews or SRD content (when published) can be used without ownership checks.

---

## **What You Cannot Do**

This license does **not** allow you to:

* Sell or rent any product containing DC20 content.
* Charge for access to a tool, module, or app containing DC20 content.
* Redistribute any DC20 product in full or in part in a way that competes with official releases.
* Copy large sections of text from DC20 products into your own works.
* Use DC20 trademarks (including the DC20 logo) without written permission, except to say “Compatible with DC20” in plain text.

---

## **Attribution Requirement**

You must include this notice in your work (digital or physical):

> *“DC20 content © 2025 Dungeon Coach Games LLC. Used under the DC20 Community Use License. See [thedungeoncoach.com/license](https://thedungeoncoach.com/license).”*

For video/audio works, include the notice in the video description or show notes.

---

## **Revocation**

If you violate this license, permission is automatically revoked. Dungeon Coach Games LLC may revoke permission for any project with 14 days’ notice if it is harmful to the brand or community.

---

# **2. DC20 Creator License (CCL)**

*For commercial works and monetized projects*

---

## **Purpose**

The DC20 Creator License is for publishers, developers, and game masters who want to create and sell products that use DC20 content.

If you plan to make money from your DC20-compatible project, you must apply for this license.

---

## **What Requires the Creator License**

You must obtain this license if you:

* Sell adventures, supplements, or modules that include DC20 rules, stats, or other proprietary content.
* Sell digital tools, apps, or VTT modules containing DC20 content (including Patreon exclusives).
* Run paid games or events that distribute DC20 materials to participants.
* Use DC20 content as part of a crowdfunding campaign (Kickstarter, Gamefound, etc.) in deliverables.

---

## **Default Terms**

* **Revenue Split:** 70% to licensee / 30% to DC20, unless a different royalty or flat-fee is negotiated.
* **Approval:** All projects must be submitted for review before publication.
* **Attribution:** Same as the Community Use License, plus display the “Licensed DC20 Creator” badge provided by DC20.
* **Reporting:** Monthly or quarterly sales reporting.
* **Exclusivity:** Non-exclusive unless otherwise agreed in writing.

---

## **Application Process**

1. Complete the application form at: **[thedungeoncoach.com/license/apply](https://thedungeoncoach.com/license/apply)**
2. DC20 will review and provide:

   * The standard Creator License agreement, or
   * A custom license for unique arrangements.

---

## **Ineligible Works**

Projects that promote hate speech, harassment, or discrimination are not eligible for licensing.

---

# **3. DC20 Tool & Content Policy**

*For VTTs, app developers, and toolmakers*

---

## **Purpose**

To help developers build great DC20-compatible tools while protecting DC20’s premium content from unlicensed distribution.

---

## **Open Content**

When the DC20 System Reference Document (SRD) is published, its content will be freely usable in tools without restrictions. Until then, all DC20 rules and materials are proprietary and subject to either the Community Use License (free tools) or Creator License (monetized tools).

---

## **Rules for Using Proprietary Content in Tools**

* **Ownership Check:** If your tool includes text from a paid DC20 product, you must verify that each user owns that product before showing the content.
* **No Bulk Export:** Tools must not allow full-text export of proprietary content.
* **Attribution:** Display:

  > *“DC20 content © 2025 Dungeon Coach Games LLC. Used with permission. See [thedungeoncoach.com/license](https://thedungeoncoach.com/license).”*
* **Registration:** All tools using proprietary content must be registered with DC20 via the license form.

---

## **Free vs Paid Tools**

* **Free tools** may operate under the Community Use License as long as they follow the above rules.
* **Paid tools** or tools with monetized features (including Patreon access) require the Creator License.

---

## **Violation**

Unlicensed distribution of DC20 content may result in DMCA takedowns and loss of license.
